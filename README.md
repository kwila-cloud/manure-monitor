# Manure Monitor: Manure Management System
Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a multi-tenant mobile/web application that will automate the tracking and calculation of chicken manure spreading across multiple farms and fields. Each customer organization will have their own isolated SQLite database instance, with separate user accounts, farms, and field data.

## Goals
- Digitize the manual process of recording manure loads
- Automate calculations for spread weight and rate per acre
- Support multiple farms, each with multiple fields
- Track historical spreading data
- Generate reports for regulatory compliance
- Provide offline capability with synchronization

## User Personas

### Primary User: Field Operator
- Needs to quickly log load weights while in the field
- May have limited connectivity in rural areas
- Requires simple, intuitive interface that works with dirty/gloved hands
- Needs to see running totals and calculations in real-time

### Secondary User: Farm Manager/Owner
- Needs to review spreading data across all fields and farms
- Requires reports for regulatory compliance
- Wants to analyze spreading rates and efficiency

### Administrator: Organization Admin
- Needs to add/manage farms, fields, and operators
- Requires comprehensive reporting capabilities
- Wants to ensure data accuracy and completeness

- Implement local-first architecture with Flutter
- User, farm, and field management
- Basic job and load tracking
- Simple reporting
- Cross-platform app with offline capability
- Basic synchronization mechanism
- Web admin dashboard (using Flutter Web)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Sync and Features
- Robust synchronization with conflict resolution
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Data visualization (charts, graphs)
- Improved offline functionality
- Sync status monitoring and management
- API integrations (if applicable)

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Performance improvements for SQLite operations
- Sync efficiency enhancements
- User feedback incorporation
- Additional features based on initial usage
- Scale integration (if available)
- Evaluation of database scaling needs

## Technologies
- Frontend: Flutter (Dart) for all platforms
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance backend
- Database: SQLite for local storage (using sqflite package)
- Sync Layer: Custom REST API with timestamp-based syncing
- Central Storage: PostgreSQL for reliable central data
- Cloud hosting: AWS/Azure with containerization
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with Flutter build pipelines
- State Management: Riverpod or Bloc pattern
- Localization: Flutter's i18n support for future expansion

## Security Considerations
- Local data encryption for SQLite databases
- Secure sync mechanism with authentication
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with agricultural data privacy regulations
- Secure API access with rate limiting
- Device-level security recommendations

## SQLite-Specific Considerations
- Regular vacuum operations to maintain database performance
- Appropriate indexing for sync-related queries
- Transaction management for data integrity
- Backup strategy for local databases
- Database versioning and migration strategy
- Handling of database corruption scenarios

## Synchronization Strategy
1. Each device maintains a local SQLite database
2. Changes are tracked with timestamps and sync status flags
3. When online, devices sync with central server in background
4. Conflicts are resolved using last-modified timestamp and predefined rules
5. Central server aggregates all data for reporting and dashboard
6. Periodic full sync to ensure data consistency

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in manual calculation errors
- Time saved per job (target: 15 minutes)
- User adoption rate (target: 90% of operators within 2 months)
- Sync success rate (target: 99.5%)
- Reduction in paper usage
- Improved reporting accuracy for compliance

## Maintenance Plan
- Regular backups of all local and central databases
- Scheduled maintenance for central synchronization server
- Monitoring of sync failures and resolution
- Scheduled updates and feature additions
- User feedback collection and incorporation
- Technical support process for field operators

## Conclusion
This app will significantly improve the efficiency of manure spreading operations by automating calculations, reducing errors, and providing valuable insights through data analytics. The SQLite-based architecture ensures operators can work effectively even in areas with limited connectivity, while the synchronization mechanism ensures data integrity and availability for reporting and analysis.
